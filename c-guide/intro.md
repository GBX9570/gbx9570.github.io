# The C programming Language
C is a language made in 1978 for developing the Unix operating system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), because portability (running the same code on different types of computer) was near impossible when writing in pure assembly (the language one
level below C, the instructions given straight to the CPU (the brains of the computer) that only make sense to that specific CPU).

# Why learn C?
C, despite its age, is still brilliant for fast, portable and low level (close to the hardware) programs. It is still used in almost every application, from creating operating systems to creating mobile games.

# Isn't C hard?
No, maybe, yes, probably not, probably üëç

# Do I need to have prior programming experience to follow this?
Preferably yes, but I am writing this as I learn C - so I will explain everything in as simple terms as possible, for my own sanity as much as yours.
